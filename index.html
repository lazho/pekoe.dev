            As part of the program requirements, 
            I was part of a team of 5 students that adapted
            the board game <em>Legends of Andor</em> into a multiplayer video game,
            which we achieved using Unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under supervision of Prof. Jerome Wahldispuhl, I contributed to
            the research game <em>Phylo</em>, where players solve gene alignment
            puzzles in order to take advantage of the distributed efforts of
            a mass audience to discover new solutions to existing problems.

            In addition to coursework related to games and graphics,
            I have also taken courses about networks and distributed systems,
            AI/ML/NLP, as well as programming language design.
