      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a developer with experience designing, building, and generally poking around APIs/web services.
        My interests mostly include games and interactive media.
        As of time of writing, I work for Behaviour Interactive on the multiplayer title <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.

            Development of the backend service of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, a live service multiplayer game with 3M MAU.
            The backend enables the live service components of the game,
            with features as authentication, rich presence, matchmaking, store/inventory, and player data management.

            Recently, I lead the design and implementation of cross-platform DLC sharing,
            which allows players who own the game on multiple platforms to keep their purchases
            and play them on any platform that is supported. During release we saw an immediate doubling of CCU.

            As part of the program requirements, 
            I was part of a team of 5 students that adapted
            the board game <em>Legends of Andor</em> into a multiplayer video game,
            which we achieved using Unity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under supervision of Prof. Jerome Wahldispuhl, I contributed to
            the research game <em>Phylo</em>, where players solve gene alignment
            puzzles in order to take advantage of the distributed efforts of
            a mass audience to discover new solutions to existing problems.
          </p>

            In addition to coursework related to games and graphics,
            I have also taken courses about networks and distributed systems,
            AI/ML/NLP, as well as programming language design.
